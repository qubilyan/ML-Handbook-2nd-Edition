## Important Notes
The book primarily uses Java and Clojure languages. There's a chapter on R too, and certain sections incorporate bash scripting. The selected machine learning frameworks are Weka and DeepLearning4J.

## Repository Structure
The code and data are organized into separate directories. Within the code directory, the languages are further segmented and then categorized under the relevant chapter numbers.

## Building the Code
Where possible, each code chapter has its own Maven pom.xml file, for Java code, or a Leiningen project file for Clojure code. Build instructions are typically within the chapter text itself.
