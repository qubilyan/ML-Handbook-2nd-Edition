What Is Machine Learning?

Let’s start at the start, looking at what machine learning actually is, it’s history and where it is used in industry. I’ll also run down some of the software used throughout the book too so you can have everything installed and be ready to get working on the practical things.

The Definition Of Machine Learning

So what is the definition of machine learning? Over the last six decades we’ve had the pioneers steering us in the right direction.

Alan Turing

Alan Turing posed the question, “Can machines think?” in his 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”. The paper went on to suggest the “Imitation Game” where three participants, a human acting as a judge, another human and a computer which is attempting to convince the judge that it is human. The judge would type into a terminal program and “talk” to the other two participants. Both the human and the computer respond and the judge decide which is the computer. During the test if the judge consistently can’t tell the difference between the human and computer responses then the computer has won the game.

The test goes on today in the form of the Loebner Prize which is an annual competition in artificial intelligence. The aim is simple enough; convince the judges that they are chatting to a human instead of a computer chat bot program.

Arthur Samuel

“[A] Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” was the definition of machine learning that Arthur Samuel gave back in 1959. Samuel is credited to have one of the self-learning computer programs with his work at IBM, he focused on games as a way of getting the computer to learn things.

The game of choice for Samuel was checkers as it was a simple game but with enough strategy involved that the program could learn from. With the use of alpha-beta evaluation pruning and minimax strategies the program would discount moves and thus improve costly memory performance of the program.

While Samuel is widely know for his work in artificial intelligence he was also noted for being one of the first programmers to use hash tables, he certainly made a big impact at IBM.

Tom M. Mitchell

Tom M. Mitchell is the Chair of Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. As author of the book “Machine Learning” he is much quoted with the definition:

“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves the experience E.”

The important thing here is that we now have a set of objects to define our machine learning.

• Task (T), either one or more.
• Experience (E)
• Performance (P)
So with a computer running a set of tasks the experience should be leading to performance increases.

To Sum Up

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. Using computing we design systems that can learn from data in either a manner of being trained or not. The systems may learn and improve with experience and with time
