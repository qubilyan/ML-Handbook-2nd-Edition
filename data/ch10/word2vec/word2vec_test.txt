Chapter 1

What Is Machine Learning?

Let’s start at the start, looking at what machine learning actually is, it’s history and where it is used in industry. I’ll also run down some of the software used throughout the book too so you can have everything installed and be ready to get working on the practical things.

The Definition Of Machine Learning

So what is the definition of machine learning? Over the last six decades we’ve had the pioneers steering us in the right direction.

Alan Turing

Alan Turing posed the question, “Can machines think?” in his 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”. The paper went on to suggest the “Imitation Game” where three participants, a human acting as a judge, another human and a computer which is attempting to convince the judge that it is human. The judge would type into a terminal program and “talk” to the other two participants. Both the human and the computer respond and the judge decide which is the computer. During the test if the judge consistently can’t tell the difference between the human and computer responses then the computer has won the game.

The test goes on today in the form of the Loebner Prize which is an annual competition in artificial intelligence. The aim is simple enough; convince the judges that they are chatting to a human instead of a computer chat bot program.

Arthur Samuel

“[A] Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” was the definition of machine learning that Arthur Samuel gave back in 1959. Samuel is credited to have one of the self-learning computer programs with his work at IBM, he focused on games as a way of getting the computer to learn things.

The game of choice for Samuel was checkers as it was a simple game but with enough strategy involved that the program could learn from. With the use of alpha-beta evaluation pruning and minimax strategies the program would discount moves and thus improve costly memory performance of the program.

While Samuel is widely know for his work in artificial intelligence he was also noted for being one of the first programmers to use hash tables, he certainly made a big impact at IBM.

Tom M. Mitchell

Tom M. Mitchell is the Chair of Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. As author of the book “Machine Learning” he is much quoted with the definition:

“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves the experience E.”

The important thing here is that we now have a set of objects to define our machine learning.

• Task (T), either one or more.
• Experience (E)
• Performance (P)
So with a computer running a set of tasks the experience should be leading to performance increases.

To Sum Up

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. Using computing we design systems that can learn from data in either a manner of being trained or not. The systems may learn and improve with experience and with time refine a model that can be used to predict outcomes of questions based on the previous learning.



Algorithmic Types For Machine Learning

There are a number of different methods that can be employed to machine learning. The deciding factor on what algorithm to use is really based on the required output. As you work through the chapters you’ll see the different algorithm types being put to work.

Supervised Learning

When we talk about supervised learning we are working a set of labeled training data. For every example in the training data we have an input object and an output object. An example would be classifying Twitter data (I’ll be using Twitter data lot in the final two chapters) lets assume we have the following data from Twitter, this would be our input data objects.

I’ve got my Hadoop cluster working on a load of data. #data
In order for our supervised learning classifier to know the outcome result of each tweet we have to manually put the answers in, for clarity I’ve added the resulting output object at the start of the line.

Obviously for the classifier to make any sense of the data when run properly we’ll have to manually work on a lot more input data. What we have though is a training set that can be used for later classification of data.

There are issues with supervised learning that have to be taken in to account. The bias-variance dilemma is one of them, how the machine-learning model performs accurately against different training sets. With high bias models with restricted learning or high variance, which learn with complexity against noisy training data. There’s a trade off between the two. The key is where to settle with the trade off.

Unsupervised Learning

On the opposite side of the coin, unsupervised learning is where we let the algorithm just find a hidden pattern in a load of data. There’s no error in the solution we propose it’s just a case of running the machine-learning algorithm and seeing what comes out.

The mention of unsupervised learning may be more a case of just data mining. If you’re looking at clustering data then there’s a good chance you’re going to spend a lot of time with unsupervised learning.

The Human Touch

Outcomes will change, data will change and requirements will change. Machine learning cannot be seen as the write it once solution to problems. Also it will require human hands to and intuition to write these algorithms to start off with. Remember that Arthur Samuel’s checkers program was basically to improve on what the human had already taught it. It all started off with a human first and it’s important that we get this message across.
